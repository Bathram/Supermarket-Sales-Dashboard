SUPERMARKET SALES DASHBORAD
I have just built an excellent dashboard for ‘Supermarket sales’  Analysis, using Excel.

To reduce the risks inherent in decision-making, I present to you ‘Data Visualization’ that will make the Supermarket and other businesses make informed decision.

These were achieved with the use of some Excel tools; Slicers, timeline, Line graph, bar chart, column chart and pie chart.

This dashboard bring data to life, offering a broad understanding of business landscape through fascinating  visualizations.

BRIEF DISCRIPTION OF CHARTS

REGION WITH HIGHEST PRODUCT: Through the use of column chart, the number of goods supply  to region was able to be ascertained as shown.

COMMON PAYMENT MODE: The ability of the supermarket to ascertain the favorable payment mode for their customers was exposed through the bar chart.

PRODUCT WITH THE HIGHEST PROFIT: The ability to know the products that give more profit in your business is sacrosanct. This was achieved in this supermarket through the bar chart.

PRODUCT WITH HIGHEST EXPENSES: Of a truth, some products affect businesses negatively maybe due to expenses attached to such product. This was made known with use of line graph.
Additionally, Slicers and Timeline were introduced to automatically show us the activities of business happening simultaneously across board.
Finally, this dashboard was created to give insight to the management of this supermarket. To enable them make  decisions  with fact.
